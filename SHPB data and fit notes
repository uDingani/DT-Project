Overview of Your Script
Input Collection: You prompt the user for SHPB parameters (e.g., Young's modulus, bar/specimen dimensions, wave speed) and a CSV file path containing voltage-time data.

Data Processing: 
Converts voltage data to strain using a calibration factor.

Calculates incident, reflected, and transmitted strains, then derives strain rate, strain, and stress.

Computes the Dynamic Increase Factor (DIF) based on static and dynamic strength.

Machine Learning:
Trains an MLPRegressor to predict stress, strain, and strain rate from input parameters and strain data.

Scales features and targets using StandardScaler.

Output: 
Prints experimental and predicted results.

Saves results to a CSV file and generates plots (stress-strain curve and DIF vs. strain rate).

Saves the trained model and scalers using joblib.
